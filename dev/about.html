        <p>Re-Cycles was founded on the principle that our limited natural resources should be used wisely. As such, our goals are to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Put more bicycles on the road by providing affordable, recycled bikes to the community</li>
            <li>Provide low-cost access to a fully equipped bike repair shop</li>
            <li>Reduce materials going into landfills by recycling bikes and bike parts (See this offsite page about a trip to the metal recyclers)</li>
            <li>Promote a healthier environment and lifestyle</li>
            <li>Offer a place for like-minded bike enthusiasts to meet and exchange ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are lots of ways to get involved. Most activities happen in the shop, but there&#39;s always extra-curricular things going oh as well. Please see our Volunteer page for more info.</p>
        <p>Also, please see our Staff page to learn about the core group of volunteers that keep re-Cycles running smoothly. And to help keep things running well we have developed some Policies and Procedures.</p>
        <h2 id="history">History</h2> 
        <p>re-Cycles began as &quot;Recycle Cycles&quot;, modelled after (and borrowing the logo from) a similar shop in Kitchener, Ont. where re-Cycles Founder Lloyd Deane had volunteered. Lloyd moved to Ottawa, became aware that this much larger city didn&#39;t have a community bike co-op, and set to work correcting that (story below). In 2011, with thanks to OPIRG-Carleton for their administration and understanding, the old re-Cycles was terminated. Its assets were transferred to the new, incorporated (as a non-profit) entity know as &quot;re-Cycles Community Bicycle Shop (re-Cycles)&quot;.</p>
