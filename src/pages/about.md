# About Re-Cycles

Re-Cycles was founded on the principle that our limited natural resources should be used wisely. As such, our goals are to:

- Put more bicycles on the road by providing affordable, recycled bikes to the community
- Provide low-cost access to a fully equipped bike repair shop
- Reduce materials going into landfills by recycling bikes and bike parts (See this offsite page about a trip to the metal recyclers)
- Promote a healthier environment and lifestyle
- Offer a place for like-minded bike enthusiasts to meet and exchange ideas

There are lots of ways to get involved. Most activities happen in the shop, but there's always extra-curricular things going oh as well. Please see our Volunteer page for more info.

Also, please see our Staff page to learn about the core group of volunteers that keep re-Cycles running smoothly. And to help keep things running well we have developed some Policies and Procedures.

## History

re-Cycles began as "Recycle Cycles", modelled after (and borrowing the logo from) a similar shop in Kitchener, Ont. where re-Cycles Founder Lloyd Deane had volunteered. Lloyd moved to Ottawa, became aware that this much larger city didn't have a community bike co-op, and set to work correcting that (story below). In 2011, with thanks to OPIRG-Carleton for their administration and understanding, the old re-Cycles was terminated. Its assets were transferred to the new, incorporated (as a non-profit) entity know as "re-Cycles Community Bicycle Shop (re-Cycles)".
